# Prayer_Request
Full stack web application for a church prayer request database. 

Prayer is powerful. A CNN article showed those who are devoutly religious (those with a strong prayer life) tend to heal faster than those who aren't religious.
A strong community of praying people is powerful for the community, as well as each individual.
Unfortunately, we are imperfect people and don't treat every prayer equally.
Prayers get lost in the limited database of the mind.
This application seeks to solve the problem of a church email prayer chain.
The design for this application will be a one to many relationship between a user and prayer.
Each user in the system must have a unique user ID and can make multiple prayer requests.
The foreign user ID in the prayer request table will seamlessly link prayers to people.
This application is built from the back forward.
We already have our Database schema. 
We aim to turn this into a wonderful user interface using HTML / CSS / JS and other libraries and frameworks as fit for the front end.
The backend will consist of MYSQL server and PHP.

Testing.
